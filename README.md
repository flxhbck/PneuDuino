# PneuDuino

Pneuduino is a toolkit for controlling air flow and pressure to design robots that are soft, furniture that is adaptive, clothing that is intelligent, art pieces that are breathing, and many more things.

Disclaimer:
This toolkit is currently designed for workshops that we give. We are working on a more stable version for personal use. In the meantime, you are welcome to use what you find here - but be aware that is a work in progress.
